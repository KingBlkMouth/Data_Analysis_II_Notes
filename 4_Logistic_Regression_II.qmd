## Learning Objectives

After successful completion of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe how to examine the goodness of fit of a logistic regression model.
- Explain what an empirical logit is, why itâ€™s useful and how to calculate it.
- Describe how to compare two logistic regression models.
- Define over dispersion (or extra-binomial variation), and indicate why it can cause problems for inference in logistic regression.
- List some reasons that counts may exhibit extra-binomial variation.

In R:

- Estimate and interpret the dispersion parameter.
- Create exploratory plots for logistic regression using the empirical logit.
- Use the deviance residuals to examine goodness of fit of the logistic regression model.
- Prepare and submit an R markdown script.
